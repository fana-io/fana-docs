# Introduction

![F√°na logo](/img/fana_logo_color_forwhitebg.png)

## Welcome to F√°na!üëã

F√°na is an open-source feature flagging platform specializing in audience targeting. Using F√°na's robust audience targeting capabilities, developers can build confidence in their feature releases by progressively deploying to larger subsets of users and controlling feature toggles in real-time.

üìÉ To read more about why and how we built F√°na, check out our [technical case study](https://Fana-io.github.io/).

## Getting Started

- üê≥ Deploy locally in one step [using Docker](https://github.com/fana-io/fana-deploy#using-docker), or
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Use [F√°na's AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/fana-io/fana-deploy#using-fanas-javascript-cdk)

## About F√°na

F√°na offers a simple, straightforward frontend interface to manage flags and their audiences, making for an intuitive user experience with a minimal learning curve. F√°na allows developers to selectively serve experiences to particular audiences, while allowing for remote toggling in real-time.

### F√°na Entities

F√°na has three closely related entities at its core: Attributes, Audiences, and Flags. Together, they enable F√°na users to target intentional segments of users within their application. To get started using F√°na, users should first create these entities in the F√°na dashboard.

- Attributes are qualities that serve to describe a user. The values can be of data types strings, numbers, or booleans, and are used to evaluate a user‚Äôs eligibility against the conditions within an audience.
- Audiences are reusable collections of logical conditions.
  - Conditions are made up of attributes, operators, and a target value.
  - Users can create robust audiences by evaluating conditions with the `ANY` or `ALL` combinations.
- Flags are the core entity of F√°na. Each flag is meant to represent a specific feature that the F√°na user wishes to test.
  - Flags are toggled off by default when created
  - Users can specify audiences within a flag to target specific users

### Architecture

At a high level, F√°na's main components are:

1. [Manager Platform](https://github.com/Fana-io/Fana-manager):

- Backend API & PostgreSQL database
- React dashboard UI for developers to manage feature flags and create audiences

2. F√°na Software Development Kits (SDKs) to embed in either client-side or server-side applications that want to use F√°na's feature flagging service

- [React](https://github.com/Fana-io/Fana-react-sdk)
- [NodeJS](https://github.com/Fana-io/Fana-node-sdk)

3. [Flag Bearer](https://github.com/Fana-io/Fana-flag-bearer) reverse proxy designed to stream and serve flag data to SDKs
