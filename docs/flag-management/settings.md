# Settings

The Settings page can be accessed by clicking on the _Settings_ section in the left navigation bar on the dashboard. It holds both of your SDK keys: one for Node Server and one for React Client. You should use these when setting up the SDK in your application.

It also provides the option to regenerate your SDK keys, if for whatever reason you need to change it.

## Important notes about regenerating your SDK Keys

- This will invalidate your current SDK Keys, so do this with caution
- Any SDKs that are currently connected will remain connected and will continue to receive updates until they are re-initialized
